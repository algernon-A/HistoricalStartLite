# Cities Skylines 2 : Historical Start
Enables more historical city building when using the game's unlocking progression system by unlocking from the start of the game:
1. **Rail**
1. **Shipping**
1. **Specialized Industry** (farming/mining/logging)

Also enables placement of **train stations** and **cargo terminals** without having to place a depot first.

This makes it much easier to lay out and grow a city that historically would have been founded prior to the automobile era, and enables you to properly utilize the transportation networks and/or industries those cities would have been originally founded for and developed around.

To (partially) offset this the XP gains for these items have been reduced by 90%, and you will also still need to manually unlock (and spend the point for) the 'Train' progression node in the transportation progression tree if you want to unlock the subsequent nodes.		

## Instructions
None needed - simply install the mod!  Rail and shipping should be unlocked automatically.

## Requirements
- BepInEx 5

## Installation
1. Make sure that BepInEx 5 is installed.
1. Place the `HistoricalStartLite` folder in the archive in your BepInEx `Plugins` folder.

## Support
It's usually easiest to contact me at the [**Cities: Skylines modding Discord**](https://discord.gg/ZaH2zjtk), or I'm also contactable as u/algernon_A on the [Cities: Skylines modding Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylinesModding) (r/CitiesSkylinesModding).  You could also raise an issue on the GitHub.

## Limitations
Sub-objects aren't yet supported in this version, so if you use this to place buildings they won't have any of their sub-components (such as props, embedded networks, or sub-buildings).  The full version of this mod rectifies this.

Vehicles *can* be placed, but will get confused and likely do strange things, which does have its amusement value at least.  The full version will allow you to place vehicles as 'props' (so they just sit there and look pretty, and not e.g. rise up nose-first into the sky in various geometric patterns).

### Modders
Modders (and aspiring modders!), as always I'm available and happy to chat about what I've done and answer any questions, and also about how you can implement anything that I've done for your own mods.  Come grab me on the Cities: Skylines Modding Discord!
